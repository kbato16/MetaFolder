# MetaFolder
## About
Custom File Explorer that includes a tagging, and a search feature stored in a database (in this case using [LiteDB](https://www.litedb.org/)). The idea is to eventually be implemented as an Autodesk Revit Add-in to provide efficiencies in the users workflow. Tagging system will allow project folders to be tagged with specific metadata such as project clients, store banners, or project locations.
